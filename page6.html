  You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line to the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would not speak each other.

    Would <span>not</span> speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem are speaking <span>to each other,</span> not <span>you to them or they</span> to you.

    <span>I will tell you what I miss:</span> I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: The End. I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, <span>at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence,</span> are the dark letters spelling <span>The End.</span>

        It was its own thrill. I<span> didn’t </span>ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, <span>and the feeling of loss,</span> the sadness of having <span>finished </span>
  the book.
